Hilar-Prox1-Cells-Quantification
================================

These are a series of scripts in Javascript  for Photoshop, Python scripts and macros in ImageJ to estimate the number of immuno-reactive Prox1 cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in mice

================================
The scripts can be used individually .You can go ahead and copy or contribute to any of the scripts.

================================

Note: All the scripts are a work in progress and were written for my use. There might be more than one script in each folder. This may correspond to different ROIs or different groups of animals.
Example, in these scripts I had the group "P16_P30_P60" and "Cre Bax", and  for ROIs I had "H","Hilus", and "SGZ".
